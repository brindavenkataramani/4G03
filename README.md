# Physics 4G03
Solutions to problems from Physics 4G03, taught at McMaster University during the Fall 2018 term. Most problems and solutions are implemented in C. Plots are generally generated using matplotlib and pandas in Python.

## Problems and solutions

1. Implementation of Lanczos algorithm in Matlab [[lanczos.m]](http://www.google.fr/)
    * Written so I could make sure I wasn't losing my mind when trying to implement the same thing in C.
    * Super barebones; feel free to use it for your own implementations.
